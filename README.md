# Progfun-scala
####This is a repository to save my progress through the course offered by Coursera.org "Functional Programming Principles in Scala" with Martin Odersky from the Ecole Polytechnique Federale de Lausanne available [here](https://www.coursera.org/learn/progfun1)
Directories refer to different weeks of the course:
* Week1 - example - covers the introductory assignment aimed at most basic syntax of Scala classes and test suites
* Week1 - recfun - implementing tail and linearly *recursive functions* on the examples of the Pascal's Triangle, Parentheses Balance Checker and a function returning the number of ways to give change with a given set of nominals
* Week2 - funsets - implementing *functional sets* (using a characteristic function) and operations on it (such as union, intersection, difference) using *anonymous functions*. Introduction of *traits* in the test suite.

* And additionally the progfun-videoExercises that contains worksheets used during the video lectures to practice new concepts on the go.
